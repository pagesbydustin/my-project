For equipment specifications, see our Equipment List . Audio \u00b6 The Allen & Heath Qu-16 is a digital mixer that allows you to manage and control audio for live events. Here\u2019s a brief overview of how audio works on this mixer: Signal Flow : Audio signals from microphones and instruments are connected to the input channels on the mixer. Each channel processes the audio signal independently. Preamp and Gain : The preamp boosts the audio signal to a usable level. Adjust the gain to ensure the signal is strong without clipping. EQ (Equalization) : Use the EQ controls to adjust the frequency response of each channel. This helps to enhance the sound quality by boosting or cutting specific frequencies. Dynamics : Apply compression and gating to control the dynamic range of the audio signal. Compression reduces the volume of loud sounds, while gating eliminates unwanted noise. Mixing : Use the faders to balance the levels of all input channels. The main mix fader controls the overall output level sent to the speakers. Effects : Add reverb, delay, and other effects to enhance the audio. Effects can be applied to individual channels or the entire mix. Monitoring : Use the headphone output and monitor mix controls to listen to the audio. This allows you to make adjustments in real-time. Output : The final mixed audio is sent to the main outputs, which are connected to the PA system or recording devices. For detailed setup instructions, refer to the Setup Instructions . For detailed software configuration, see our OBS Studio Documentation . For church contact information, see our Contact Page . Feedback \u00b6 Feedback occurs when the sound from the speakers is picked up by the microphones and re-amplified, creating a loop that results in a high-pitched squeal. To prevent feedback: Microphone Placement : Position microphones away from speakers and monitors. Gain Structure : Set the gain levels properly to avoid excessive amplification. EQ Adjustments : Use the EQ to cut frequencies that are prone to feedback. Directional Microphones : Use directional microphones that pick up sound from a specific direction, reducing the chance of feedback. Microphones \u00b6 Different types of microphones are used for various purposes: Dynamic Microphones : Durable and versatile, ideal for live sound applications. They handle high sound pressure levels and are less sensitive to feedback. Condenser Microphones : More sensitive and provide a wider frequency response, making them suitable for studio recordings and capturing detailed sound. They require phantom power. Lavalier Microphones : Small, clip-on microphones used for hands-free operation, often in presentations and theater. Shotgun Microphones : Highly directional microphones used to capture sound from a distance, commonly used in film and video production. Video \u00b6 Camera Setup \u00b6 PTZ Optics : Position the PTZ Optics camera at the designated spot and connect it to the network. Tailair Cameras : Position the two Tailair cameras at their designated spots and connect them to the network. OBS Studio Configuration \u00b6 Open OBS Studio on the computer. Add video sources from the PTZ Optics and Tailair cameras. Configure the video settings (resolution, frame rate, etc.). Live Streaming \u00b6 Streaming Setup \u00b6 Open OBS Studio on the computer.

Our Beliefs \u00b6 We, as Faith Lutheran Church, proclaim God\u2019s grace and forgiveness through faith in Christ and practice it through loving community, living faithfully, and serving our neighbors and community according to God's word. At Faith Lutheran Church - Menifee, we believe in the Holy Trinity, the divinity of Jesus Christ, and the authority of the Bible. We also believe in the power of prayer and the importance of living out our faith in our daily lives. Mission Statement \u00b6 Enriching lives through faith and God's grace. Who We Are \u00b6 We are an energetic, fun-loving and faithful congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America yearning to hear God\u2019s voice leading, guiding, encouraging, and transforming us as we share the love of Christ in this place. Welcome Home \u00b6 Whatever has led you here, whether it\u2019s a lifetime of faith or a lifetime of questions, days of joy or days of pain, moments of hope or moments of frustration, we welcome you. Our Church History \u00b6 Have you ever been curious as to how \u201cFaith\u201d was the name chosen for our church? It\u2019s because it was started by a small group of individuals and they \u201c\u2026all realized that it took courage, perseverance and deep-rooted faith to start a church with such a small group.\u201d Out of that faith has come a lot of growth, exciting events, and a lot of service to our community. In the 1960s, Faith Lutheran was established and held its formal organization service at Town Hall on October 6, 1963. The current site was purchased, the first potluck dinner was enjoyed, the first congregational meeting was held and our Constitution and Bylaws were adopted. Pastors Segerhammar, Crounse, and Moyer led our church. The groundbreaking ceremony was held and construction began. The cornerstone was laid, the tall cross outside was erected and the organ and chimes were purchased. Our membership grew from 58 to 187 by the end of 1969. Pastor Moyer continued to lead Faith into the 70s followed by Pastor Miller. Faith sponsored public concerts by the Wittenberg University Choir and California Lutheran College Choir, a movie projector was gifted and Faith began having Family Movie Night. As membership grew, six new pews were installed, more hymnals were purchased, and a part-time office secretary was hired. The 10th anniversary was celebrated, missionaries from overseas mission fields visited to speak, the Fisherman\u2019s Club was established to visit non-members and invite them to church, new choir robes were purchased, and carpet was installed in the sanctuary and hall. In May 1979 thanks were given to Fred and Ruth Ditsch for the gift of new risers for the choir loft. Pastor Miller led the church into the 1980s followed by Pastor Reenstjerna. In 1981 the congregation approved plans for the Fellowship Hall and Faith members gave generously to make the project a reality. More pews were added, the Faith Women started the \u201cprayer chain,\u201d a new digital computer organ was purchased, and the number of circles grew to 9. The stained glass window project was completed, the green hymnals replaced the red, and the newsletter \u201cFaith in Action\u201d was born, but was quickly renamed the \u201cFaith Forecaster.\u201d Enter the 1990s led by Pastors Reenstjerna, Poldberg, and Stone, Faith\u2019s first female pastor. Vacation Bible School began in the 1990s, as did the Endowment Fund Committee, started by a large donation from the estate of Emma G. Rau. Faith\u2019s Service Commission was started to help members who needed transportation to the doctor, market, etc., and to help those needing home repairs. Nursery care became available for children up to 5 years of age, the Narthex was constructed, we began having both Traditional and Contemporary services and we had a new website and email address. Videotape ministry was started; the services would be taped and taken to the homes of our homebound members. The Breakfast Club offered breakfast to students from Ridgemoor Elementary School. The 2000s began with Pastor Stone receiving her doctorate to become the Rev. Dr. Judith E. Stone. A Christmas campaign was held to donate gift cards to local families. Faith\u2019s Sunday Lunch Program began, providing low-cost lunch and needed fellowship for seniors. Faith received a Certificate of Recognition for their continued support of Menifee Valley Community Cupboard. Pastor Cansino became Faith\u2019s pastor in 2007, the Faith Library, later renamed Luther Library was established and all Sunday school kids were given their own Bible. The new ELCA cranberry hymnals replaced the green hymnals, Snip 'N Stitch shipped 32 quilts for Lutheran World Relief dispersal and The Soldiers Angels sent 47 lap blankets to Menlo Park for veterans. On May 1, 2019 Faith was blessed with the arrival of our current Pastor, John Barton and his wonderful little family. We were able to share their joy in the birth of their son and daughter! Fast forward to the present and we\u2019ve survived the pandemic cycling through worship styles online, then in the parking lot, then giving thanks for returning inside the sanctuary in May of 2021. The pandemic has made church a little more challenging, a whole lot different, and all the more important as we look to our faith in God to guide us. Our wonderful congregation has persevered going through phases of virtual worship, parking lot worship, and finally back inside the sanctuary! We are blessed to have the ability to carry on and make the best of it, we are blessed by the amazing people of this congregation who love, support and care for each other and our church! Thanks be to God! These are only some of the highlights of the congregation's history. Talk to one of our long-time members to hear more and share some of your own history. Thank you to Betty Baumann, Lynn Bennett, Pr. John, and others who put together this bio of our beloved congregation.

We are blessed to have the ability to carry on and make the best of it, we are blessed by the amazing people of this congregation who love, support and care for each other and our church! Thanks be to God! These are only some of the highlights of the congregation's history. Talk to one of our long-time members to hear more and share some of your own history. Thank you to Betty Baumann, Lynn Bennett, Pr. John, and others who put together this bio of our beloved congregation. Go with God's peace.","title":"Our Church History"},{"location":"extras/contact/","text":"Contact Us \u00b6 Faith Lutheran Church - Menifee 28200 Portsmouth Dr, Menifee, CA 92586, US Phone: (951) 679-1518 For any inquiries, please contact us at FaithLutheranMenifee@gmail.com .
